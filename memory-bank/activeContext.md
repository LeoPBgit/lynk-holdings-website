# Active Context: Lynk Holdings

## Current Work Focus
**Project Initialization Phase** - Setting up the foundational structure and documentation for the Lynk Holdings investment management platform.

## Recent Changes
- Created project brief defining core requirements and scope
- Established product context with user journeys and value propositions
- Initialized memory bank structure for project documentation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. Complete memory bank setup with remaining core files:
   - systemPatterns.md (architecture decisions)
   - techContext.md (technology stack)
   - progress.md (current status)
2. Create project README.md
3. Establish .clinerules for project intelligence
4. Define initial project structure and technology choices

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. Set up development environment and project structure
2. Choose and configure technology stack
3. Create basic project scaffolding
4. Set up database schema design
5. Implement authentication system foundation

### Medium Term (Next 3-5 Sessions)
1. Develop core portfolio management features
2. Implement data integration layer
3. Create dashboard and visualization components
4. Build reporting system foundation
5. Establish security and compliance framework

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Stack Decisions Pending
- Frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular)
- Backend framework (Node.js, Python, .NET)
- Database choice (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, hybrid)
- Real-time data handling approach
- Authentication/authorization system
- Deployment and hosting strategy

### Architecture Considerations
- Microservices vs monolithic approach
- Data synchronization strategy for real-time updates
- Caching strategy for performance
- API design patterns
- Security architecture for financial data
- Scalability requirements and approach

### Current Priorities
1. **Documentation First**: Ensure comprehensive memory bank before coding
2. **Technology Selection**: Make informed choices based on requirements
3. **Security Planning**: Financial data requires robust security from start
4. **Scalability Design**: Plan for growth from the beginning
5. **User Experience**: Keep user needs central to all decisions

## Questions to Resolve
- What is the preferred technology stack for this project?
- Are there specific compliance requirements to consider?
- What is the expected user scale and growth trajectory?
- Are there existing systems that need integration?
- What is the deployment and hosting preference?

## Context Notes
- This is a greenfield project with no existing codebase
- Focus on creating a solid foundation before rapid development
- Financial domain requires extra attention to security and compliance
- User experience is critical for adoption in competitive market
