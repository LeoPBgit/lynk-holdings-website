## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Data Security**: Financial data requires robust security measures
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Must meet financial industry standards
3. **Real-time Data**: Reliable market data feed integration critical
4. **Scalability**: System must handle growth in users and data

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Third-party Dependencies**: Reliance on external data providers
2. **Performance**: Complex calculations may impact response times
3. **User Experience**: Financial interfaces can be complex to design
4. **Integration Complexity**: Multiple external system integrations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Security-first development approach
- Regular compliance reviews
- Multiple data provider fallbacks
- Performance testing throughout development
- User testing and feedback loops
- Modular architecture for easier maintenance
