# System Patterns: Lynk Holdings

## Architecture Overview
The Lynk Holdings platform follows a modern, scalable architecture designed to handle financial data with high security, performance, and reliability requirements.

## Proposed System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture Pattern
**Layered Architecture with Microservices Elements**
- Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- API Gateway Layer
- Business Logic Layer (Backend Services)
- Data Access Layer
- External Integration Layer

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Frontend Architecture
- **Pattern**: Single Page Application (SPA) with Component-Based Architecture
- **State Management**: Centralized state management for portfolio data
- **Routing**: Client-side routing for smooth user experience
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data feeds

#### 2. Backend Architecture
- **Pattern**: RESTful API with GraphQL for complex queries
- **Service Organization**: Domain-driven design with clear service boundaries
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### 3. Data Architecture
- **Primary Database**: Relational database for transactional data
- **Time-Series Database**: For historical price and performance data
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
- **Data Warehouse**: For analytics and reporting (future phase)

### Core System Patterns

#### 1. Data Flow Pattern
```
External Data Sources → Data Ingestion Service → Data Validation → 
Database Storage → API Layer → Frontend Components → User Interface
```

#### 2. Security Pattern
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for compliance

#### 3. Error Handling Pattern
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning with reduced features
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures from external services
- **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Technical errors translated to user-understandable messages

#### 4. Performance Pattern
- **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed
- **Pagination**: Handle large datasets efficiently
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for optimal performance
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization

### Component Relationships

#### Core Components
1. **User Management Service**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - User profiles and preferences
   - Role and permission management

2. **Portfolio Service**
   - Portfolio CRUD operations
   - Asset allocation calculations
   - Performance analytics

3. **Market Data Service**
   - Real-time price feeds
   - Historical data management
   - Data validation and normalization

4. **Reporting Service**
   - Report generation and scheduling
   - Data aggregation and analysis
   - Export functionality

5. **Notification Service**
   - Alert management
   - Email and push notifications
   - Event-driven communications

### Integration Patterns

#### External Data Integration
- **Adapter Pattern**: Standardize different data provider APIs
- **Polling vs Push**: Hybrid approach based on data criticality
- **Data Validation**: Multi-stage validation for data integrity
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple data sources for redundancy

#### API Design Patterns
- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Versioning Strategy**: URL-based versioning for backward compatibility
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse and ensure fair usage
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for comprehensive API docs

### Scalability Patterns

#### Horizontal Scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Database Sharding**: Partition data for better performance
- **CDN Integration**: Static asset delivery optimization
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand

#### Performance Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Query Optimization**: Minimize database load
- **Asset Optimization**: Minimize frontend bundle sizes
- **Progressive Loading**: Improve perceived performance

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Logging Pattern
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for easy parsing
- **Log Levels**: Appropriate logging levels for different environments
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across service boundaries
- **Security Logging**: Audit trails for compliance

#### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Application Metrics**: Performance and business metrics
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: System health and resource usage
- **User Analytics**: Usage patterns and feature adoption
- **Alerting**: Proactive issue detection and notification
