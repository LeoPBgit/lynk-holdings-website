# Lynk Holdings - Project Intelligence

## Project Context
This is a financial investment portfolio management platform built with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend. The project is in the initialization phase with comprehensive documentation established.

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Memory Bank First Approach
- ALWAYS read memory bank files before starting any work
- Memory bank contains complete project context and current status
- Update memory bank when significant changes or discoveries are made
- Files are hierarchical: projectbrief.md → productContext.md → systemPatterns.md → techContext.md → activeContext.md → progress.md

### Financial Domain Considerations
- Security is paramount - financial data requires robust protection
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOX) must be considered from start
- Real-time data handling is critical for market data
- Performance requirements are strict (API < 500ms, page load < 3s)
- Audit trails and logging are essential for compliance

### Technology Stack Decisions
- React 18+ with TypeScript for frontend (type safety critical)
- Node.js/Express with TypeScript for backend
- PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for time-series financial data
- Redis for caching and session management
- Material-UI for professional financial interface components

## User Preferences and Workflow

### Development Approach
- Documentation-first development (memory bank system)
- Security-first architecture decisions
- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- Comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting
- Conventional commits for clear history
- Code reviews required for all changes
- Test coverage requirements for financial calculations
- Performance monitoring from development phase

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Architecture Patterns
- Layered architecture with microservices elements
- Domain-driven design for business logic organization
- RESTful APIs with GraphQL for complex queries
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Circuit breaker pattern for external API resilience

### Data Patterns
- Time-series data optimization for historical prices
- Multi-level caching strategy (Redis, application, CDN)
- Data validation at multiple layers
- Audit logging for all financial transactions
- Backup and recovery procedures for data integrity

### Security Patterns
- JWT with refresh tokens for authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization at all entry points
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

## Known Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- Real-time data synchronization across multiple users
- Complex financial calculations requiring precision
- Integration with multiple external data providers
- Scalability for large portfolios and user bases
- Performance optimization for data-heavy operations

### Business Challenges
- Regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions
- User experience design for complex financial data
- Data accuracy and reliability requirements
- Competitive market with established players
- User trust and security perception

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Current Phase)
- Chose React/TypeScript for type safety and ecosystem
- Selected PostgreSQL for ACID compliance needs
- Decided on comprehensive documentation approach
- Established security-first development mindset

### Future Decision Points
- Microservices vs monolithic deployment strategy
- Cloud provider selection (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Financial data provider selection and contracts
- Scaling strategy as user base grows
- Advanced analytics and ML integration

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Development Tools
- VS Code with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier extensions
- Docker for consistent development environments
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

### Monitoring and Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance monitoring from day one
- Error tracking and alerting systems
- User analytics for feature adoption
- Security monitoring and audit trails

## Key Learning Points

### Financial Domain Insights
- Financial users expect professional, clean interfaces
- Data accuracy is more important than speed in many cases
- Regulatory compliance affects every architectural decision
- Users need comprehensive audit trails and reporting
- Real-time updates are critical but must be reliable

### Technical Insights
- TypeScript strict mode catches many financial calculation errors
- Time-series databases are essential for historical data
- Caching strategies must consider data freshness requirements
- Security cannot be added later - must be built in from start
- Performance testing with realistic financial data volumes is crucial

## Project Intelligence Notes

### Success Factors
- Comprehensive planning and documentation before coding
- Security and compliance considerations from project start
- User experience focus despite complex financial requirements
- Scalable architecture planning for future growth
- Strong testing culture for financial accuracy

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple data provider integrations for redundancy
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- User feedback loops throughout development

### Development Velocity Optimizers
- Memory bank system for context preservation
- Comprehensive project documentation
- Clear architectural decisions documented upfront
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- Code quality tools integrated from start

## Next Session Preparation

When starting the next session:
1. Read all memory bank files to understand current context
2. Check progress.md for current status and next steps
3. Review activeContext.md for immediate priorities
4. Consider any new insights or patterns discovered
5. Update relevant documentation if significant changes made

Remember: This project requires extra attention to security, compliance, and data accuracy due to the financial domain. Every decision should consider these factors.
